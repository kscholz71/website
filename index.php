		<div class= "army-info">Currently a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves with the 3/414th(LDAC) Unit stationed out of Ft. Lewis , Wa. Our main mission is to train and equip young cadets coming out of ROTC with the tools necessary to become confident and competent leaders in todays Army. I enlisted on January 8th 2013 and was sent to Ft Jackson South Carolina to complete basic training. In June I was bussed to endure 3 months of summer at Ft. Benning, GA for Officer Candidate School (OCS). A grueling test of physical, mental and emotional limits. Upon completion and gaining my commission I came out to Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo to complete my Engineer training. I have taken the experience the Army has given me and tried to apply it to my everyday life. They instilled the virtues of hard work, discipline and completing tasks that may seem impossible upon first glance. Young Guns! </div>

		<div class="section-title">About Me</div>
		I am always looking for a reason to get outdoors and enjoy the wornderful scenery of the Pacific Northwest. Instilled in me when I was young working outdoors for many hot summers on my uncles farm. I love kayaking, fishing, hiking, biking and plan on learning to naviagte the slopes this winter. I love to read books, all sorts of books. My favorite genre is probably fantasy and professional development. I love a good cup of coffee or a delicious meal from one of Portland's many fantastic restaurants.
